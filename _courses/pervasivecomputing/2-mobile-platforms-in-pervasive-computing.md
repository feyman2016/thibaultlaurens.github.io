#### Types of mobile devices:
* Remote controls and smart remote
* Handheld gaming devices
* Palmtops / Tablets
* Smartphones

</br>

#### Smartphones:
* Standard phone features+embedded programmable computer, dominate the market
* **Advantages**: wide range of functionality, powerful hardware
* **Disadvantages**: expensive, complex app deployment, phone network engagement

***

</br>


#### Main smartphone OS:
* iOS: priority **performance** and **user experience** ( + LLVM)
* Android: priority **flexibility** and **freedom for developers**
* WP: priority **compatibility with Microsoft technologies**

</br>

#### iOS:
* Development: C, C++ or Objective-C tools only for Mac, native code in secure space
* UI: “**cocoa touch**” model, “**springboard**” grid menu, standard hardware buttons
* Multitasking: suspend-and-restore, request to run in background
* Deployment model: **debug, public and enterprise deployment**

</br>

#### Android:
* Development: Java on an in-built VM, C/C++ limited components, v 2.3.3 most popular
* UI: java-based ui classes, user choose and customize layout, app can provide widgets
* Multitasking: apps divided into “**Activities**”, invoked by other app, suspended when not on screen, “**intents**” to discover other activities + “**services**” for background use
* Deployment model: app **self-signed by developers** (no approval process), Android market or public dl (public dl requires complex conf of the phone)

</br>

#### Windows Phone 8:
* Development: XAML/.NET (C# or VB) + Direct3D (C++)
* UI: “Modern UI”, updated “tiles”, Direct3D apps control the entire screen
* Multitasking: suspend-and-restore (in **Ram** or “**tombstoned**” state to Flash), **periodic** (every 30min for 25s) or **intensive** (run once up to 10min, wi-fi, locked…) agents
* Deployment: **licenses sold separately to software** -> trial version + other features dev

***

</br>

#### General Programming Consideration:
* “**Watchdog**” activated if a process doesn’t respond to a user input or OS event
* Desktop OS: “not responding” warning but on mobile the app crash immediately
* **Multi-threaded** apps ensure they can continue responding during long process tasks

***

</br>

#### Infrared: Simple Remote Control
* **RC-5** (European, system address up to 32 and command number up to 128, standard addresses and commands: **interchangeable and universal remotes**) or **NEC** (Japanese, addresses and commands up to 255, standardized at brand level: **avoids interferences**) IR protocol
* **IrDA** spec for smartphone and more complex comm, **IrDA-data** and **IrDA-control**, layers like TCP/IP stack (**IrCOMM** for standard comm port or **IrLAN** for LAN connection)

</br>

#### Bluetooth:
* Similar to WiFi technique but 100m, multiple “profiles” for different ranges of function
* **Bluetooth Smart**: new, medium-range com, lower speed for less power
* Discovery and Pairing: **GAP** (Generic Access Profile) specifies **SDP** (Service Discovery Protocol). **Inquiry** signal send and **discoverable** devices resp with their id + profiles supported, **pairing** with shared access key for some connection
* Security concerns: profile with no pairing configured -> silently attacked

</br>

#### NFC:
* 4cm, radio signal conveyed by magnetic induction, electromagnetic field generated by one device can power the other so use of unpowered passives devices OK
* Apps: close proximity data exchange, contactless card replacement, phone can read data in passive devices

</br>

#### WIFI:
* Radio signals using **IEEE 802.11** standard
* **Adhoc** (no internet) or **infrastructure** (with central access point)mode
* Optional encryption (WEP insecure, WPA or WPA2 stronger)

</br>

#### 3G:
* 3rd generation protocols / **EDGE** (US) or **UMTS** (Europe) protocols

</br>

#### 4G:
* **Mobile WIMAX** (Japan) or **LTE** (Europe+USA) protocols -> 100Mb/s
* “Tragedy of the anticommons”: patents held by 50+ company to dev 4G hardware
