#### A monitoring model

* Measure progress made
* Compare with work planned
* Evaluate what action needed to re-align to plan
* Predict consequences of no action or corrective action
* Act: deal with problems as they occur

<br/>

#### Progress report:

* Aim: inform management of progress achieved in relation to schedule
* Content:
    - Current status – in relation to schedule
    - Progress – milestones and goals accomplished
    - Problems and issues – how sere/will problems be resolved
    - Recommendation and requests
    - Plan for the next project phase

<br/>

#### Frederic Taylor, Taylorism (now forms the basis of coaching)

* Select best person for the job (recruitment)
* Instruct best method (mentoring, best practice, training)
* Provide incentives to effective workers (appraisal system, promotion)

<br/>

#### Donal McGregor

* Theory X: We dislike work, we need to coerce, direct and control (e.g. click in), people avoid responsibility
* Theory Y: Work is part of life, coercion is not the only means of motivation, commitment is related to reward and achievement

<br/>

#### Motivation Theories:

* Intrinsic – activity completed for own job satisfaction
* Extrinsic – pressure is applied by reward or to avoid penalty

<br/>

#### Working in teams:

* Bruce Tuckman model of team development and behaviour with stages: forming > storming > norming > performing > adjourning
* Personality type (Belbin or Myers-Briggs): Extravert/Intravert, Sensing/Intuition, Thinking/Feeling, Judging/Perception

<br/>

#### Leadership: Ability to motivate and focus a team towards achieving goals

<br/>

#### Project Monitoring:

* Quality: product and process quality
* Change: change requests and configuration management
* Progress: time spent, tasks accomplished, products completed

<br/>

#### Visualising progress:

* Gantt chart: activity bar showing progress against dates
* Slip chart: compare actual progress on each activity
* Ball chart: show whether task targets are met

<br/>

#### Risk reporting: assess each task using traffic light method

* Green – on target
* Orange – not on target but recoverable
* Red – not on target and recoverable only with difficulty

<br/>

#### PRINCE2: Project IN Controlled Environments

* Structured methods
* Process based approach
* Manage projects in a logical and organised way following the defined steps/stages:
    - Starting up a project (SU): ensures that the prerequisites for initiating a project are available
    - Planning (a common process used by others)
    - Initiating a project (IP): defines the “what, why, who, when and how of the project”
    - Directing a project (DP): runs after the SU until the completion of the project
    - Managing stage boundaries (SB): checking stage results and required resources
    - Controlling a stage (CS)
    - Managing product delivery (MP)
    - Closing a project (CP)
